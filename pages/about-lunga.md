In the year 2000 LungA Art festival was held for the first time. It’s an intimate art festival where creativity, arts and culture are celebrated with workshops, lectures and events. The festival goes off with a bang in a culmination of exhibitions and concerts that take place over the final weekend. 

LungA has earned quite the reputation, both locally and internationally, for its great ambiance, good-quality workshops and the fantastic enthusiasm of the participants year on year.   Furthermore, the festival has fostered joy, self-knowledge, new lovers, new friends and warm memories to those who come to participate in it. 

The LungA “family” now consists of both the yearly art festival and the LungA school. These are separately run projects but they share the same name, values and ideology. 

## YOUTH EXCHANGE– ERASMUS+

Over the last decade we have offered a youth exchange program in collaboration with ERASMUS+. The Youth Exchange project is built around a three day workshop where youth from 3-4 European countries meet and dive into the yearly theme of the festival.  From the theme and collaboration stems an array of interesting lectures which aims to activate a dialogue about social and individual responsibility.

## The Theme

This year’s theme is GENDER. The Youth Exchange groups will participate from the Kaospilot school in Denmark, University of Brighton in England, Hyper Island in Sweden and the Reykjavik School of Visual Arts in Iceland. We’re going to attempt to discuss gender away from any pre-conditioned beliefs. Rather we’re going to take a deep look into gender from all of the contemporary vantage points that have come to the surface recently. The discourse is based upon the collaboration of smaller groups, which includes panel discussions, exercises and a variety of lively inputs. 

We hope to see as many of you as possible at LungA this year.

Love! LungA.
