# LungA LAB

is what we call our informative experimental laboratorium. Each year we choose a theme, this year it is "gender" and then we dig in to that theme from many different perspectives, through workshop work, talks, various gender related performamces, movie screening, panel discussions and so on. 

This is LungA's way to contribute to the awareness of social responsibility on individual and collective level, in hope to effect and inspire those involved to take action and be more open towards the diversity of others in general. 

LungA LAB is made in collaboratiomn with Erasmus+, appelsín, Kaospilot, Hyper Island, University of Brighton, Myndlistarskóli Reykjavíkur.
